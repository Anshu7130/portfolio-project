          I’m Anusha Bandarapu, a frontend developer with over 5 years of experience crafting scalable,
          responsive web applications. I’ve worked with companies like Kemper Insurance and TCS (for
          Cardinal Health), building full-stack features using React, Angular, and Spring Boot. I specialize
          in turning complex ideas into smooth, user-friendly interfaces using modern frameworks and design systems.

          My personal projects — including a full-stack Finance Tracker and a Restaurant Management System — showcase
          my strengths in React, Node.js, MongoDB, and UI libraries like Material UI and Bootstrap.
          I’m always curious and currently exploring .NET and Blazor to broaden my backend expertise.
